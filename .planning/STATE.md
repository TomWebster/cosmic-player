## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: 2D Canvas over WebGL for balance of visual quality and implementation complexity
- [Init]: Click-to-enter splash to satisfy browser autoplay policy and create intentional threshold
- [Init]: Single playlist, externally managed via appleMusicTools pipeline
- [Init]: Local audio files first, architecture abstracts source for later cloud migration
- [Init]: No play/pause control to reinforce continuous immersive experience
- [01-01]: ES modules (type=module) for clean import/export architecture
- [01-01]: setTransform() for non-cumulative DPI scaling on resize
