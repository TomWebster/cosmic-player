# Roadmap: Cosmic Player

## Overview

The Cosmic Player roadmap delivers an immersive web audio player in four phases. Phase 1 establishes the foundation with working audio playback and user gesture-based initialization. Phase 2 builds the animated cosmic scene with multi-layer canvas rendering. Phase 3 integrates audio analysis with visual reactivity to create the core differentiator. Phase 4 adds track metadata display and final polish. Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability that builds toward the complete immersive experience.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3, 4): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (e.g., 2.1): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation & Audio Playback** - Entry mechanism, audio engine, playlist management, playback controls
- [ ] **Phase 2: Canvas Scene & Animation** - Multi-layer space scene with parallax animation
- [ ] **Phase 3: Audio Visualization** - Audio-reactive visual modulation
- [ ] **Phase 4: Track Info & Polish** - Metadata display and final refinements

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation & Audio Playback
**Goal**: Visitor can enter the experience and listen to music with full playback controls

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)

**Requirements**: ENTR-01, ENTR-02, ENTR-03, PLAY-01, PLAY-02, PLAY-03, PLAY-04, PLAY-05, PLAY-06, PLAY-07, DATA-01, DATA-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Visitor sees a click-to-enter splash screen on page load
  2. Clicking the splash creates AudioContext and begins playing the first track from the playlist
  3. User can skip to next/previous tracks and hear the correct audio play
  4. User can adjust volume with slider and mute/unmute audio
  5. Playlist auto-advances through tracks and loops back to start after the last track

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

### Phase 2: Canvas Scene & Animation
**Goal**: Full-viewport animated cosmic scene renders smoothly without audio integration

**Depends on**: Phase 1

**Requirements**: SCNE-01, SCNE-02, SCNE-03, SCNE-04, SCNE-05, SCNE-06, SCNE-07

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Infinite black space backdrop fills the entire viewport with no visible seams
  2. Sparse bright starfield, Saturn-colored planet, two khaki moons, and distant sun are all visible and positioned correctly
  3. Scene elements drift with slow parallax motion at different layer speeds
  4. Animation maintains smooth 60fps performance while audio plays

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

### Phase 3: Audio Visualization
**Goal**: Visuals react subtly to music in real-time, creating the immersive audio-visual fusion

**Depends on**: Phase 2

**Requirements**: REAC-01, REAC-02, REAC-03, REAC-04, REAC-05

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Stars pulse gently in brightness as music plays
  2. Planet glow modulates softly in response to bass frequencies
  3. Visual reactions feel atmospheric and slow, never fast or twitchy
  4. Audio-visual sync is tight with no perceptible lag or jitter

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

### Phase 4: Track Info & Polish
**Goal**: Current track metadata is visible during playback, completing the experience

**Depends on**: Phase 3

**Requirements**: INFO-01, INFO-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Current track title and artist are displayed on screen during playback
  2. Track info updates correctly when user skips to next/previous track

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
